This web application was diployed in AWS.
You can view the app here (http://hdp-env-1.eba-ssjsxice.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

Cardio-Fit is a **Machine Learning based Web Application.** It can detect whether *you are suffering from a heart disease or not*. It also creates a **personalised analytical report** depending upon your test result.

## 🎥 Demo
This demo shows how you will input the data and based on that, the ML model will predict the result along side your *personalized analytical report*.

## 🤖 Under the hood

Cardio-Fit works on a Machine Learning model made with the **Ensemble Technique** which enables it to give us a better overall result.

The model has been selected after properly visualizing and understanding the data through *statistical* means, to find the best possible features, which are most impactful to our model.

You can check out more by checking out our Kaggle Notebook which shows how our model came to be.
## 📊 Dataset

The dataset that has been used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is also present on Kaggle.
